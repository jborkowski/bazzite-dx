# Bazzite Developer Edition

[![Build Bazzite DX](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite-dx/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite-dx/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is just bazzite, but with extra developer-specific tooling, aiming to match [Bluefin DX](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/bluefin-dx/) and [Aurora DX](https://docs.getaurora.dev/dx/aurora-dx-intro) in functionality

[`bazzite-gdx`](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite-gdx) will source from here and be focused for game development.

## Installation

To rebase an existing Bazzite installation to Bazzite DX, use one of the following commands based on your current variant:

### Desktop Variants

**For KDE Plasma (default Bazzite):**
```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-dx:stable
```

**For GNOME:**
```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-dx-gnome:stable
```

### NVIDIA Variants

**For KDE Plasma with NVIDIA:**
```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-dx-nvidia:stable
```

**For GNOME with NVIDIA:**
```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-dx-nvidia-gnome:stable
```

### Handheld & HTPC Variants

**For KDE:**
```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-dx-deck:stable
```

**For GNOME:**
```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-dx-deck-gnome:stable
```

**For KDE with NVIDIA GPU:**
```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-dx-deck-nvidia:stable
```

**For GNOME with NVIDIA GPU:**
```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-dx-deck-nvidia-gnome:stable
```

### ⚠️ Important Desktop Environment Warning

**Do not switch between GNOME and KDE variants!** If you are currently running:
- **GNOME** (bazzite-gnome*): Only use the `-gnome` variants above
- **KDE Plasma** (standard bazzite): Only use the variants without `-gnome` in the name

Switching between desktop environments via rebase can break your installation and may require a complete reinstall.

After running the rebase command, reboot your system to complete the installation.
